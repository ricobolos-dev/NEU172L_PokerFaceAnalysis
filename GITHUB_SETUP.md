# GitHub Setup Instructions

## ✅ What's Already Done

- Git repository initialized
- `.gitignore` created (excludes 80GB of data files!)
- All code and documentation committed
- **114 files ready to upload** (only small files: scripts, docs, metadata)

## 📊 What's Included vs Excluded

### ✅ INCLUDED (uploaded to GitHub):
- All MATLAB scripts (*.m)
- Python notebook (poker_face_analysis.ipynb)
- Documentation (*.md files)
- Dataset metadata (.json, .tsv files)
- Behavioral data (*_events.tsv)
- **Total: ~5 MB**

### ❌ EXCLUDED (too large, not uploaded):
- Raw EEG data (*.bdf) - 80GB!
- PDF files (*.pdf) - 3.6MB
- MATLAB toolboxes (fieldtrip/, CoSMoMVPA/) - users install separately
- Processed data (derivatives/) - generated by scripts
- **Total excluded: ~80GB**

## 🚀 Next Steps: Create GitHub Repository

### 1. Create Repository on GitHub

Go to: https://github.com/new

**Settings:**
- **Repository name:** `NEU172L_Final` (or your choice)
- **Description:** The "Poker Face" Analysis: Correlating Neural Decodability with Behavioral Predictability
- **Visibility:** Public or Private (your choice)
- **DO NOT** initialize with README (you already have one!)
- **DO NOT** add .gitignore (you already have one!)

Click **"Create repository"**

### 2. Link Your Local Repo to GitHub

GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```bash
cd /Users/ricobolos/Desktop/NEU172L_Final

# Add your GitHub repo as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NEU172L_Final.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Example** (replace with your username):
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/ricobolos/NEU172L_Final.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Enter GitHub Credentials

When prompted:
- **Username:** Your GitHub username
- **Password:** Use a **Personal Access Token** (not your password!)

**To create a token:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Name it: "NEU172L Project"
4. Select scope: `repo` (all checkboxes under repo)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. **Copy the token** (you won't see it again!)
7. Use this token as your password when pushing

## ✅ Verify Upload

After pushing, check your GitHub repo:
- Should see all your .m files
- Should see poker_face_analysis.ipynb
- Should see README.md displayed on main page
- Should see sub-XX/eeg/ folders with .tsv and .json (but NO .bdf files!)

---

## 📝 Update README with Your GitHub Link

After creating the repo, update line 16 of README.md:

**Change:**
```markdown
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NEU172L_Final.git
```

**To your actual repo:**
```markdown
git clone https://github.com/ricobolos/NEU172L_Final.git
```

Then commit and push the change:
```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "Update GitHub clone URL"
git push
```

---

## 🔄 Future Updates

When you make changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push
```

---

## 🎉 You're Done!

Your repo will be at:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NEU172L_Final`

Share this link with your team and instructors!

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Raw data NOT on GitHub** - Users must download separately from OpenNeuro
2. **Toolboxes NOT on GitHub** - Users install FieldTrip and CoSMoMVPA separately
3. **Results NOT on GitHub** - Generated by running the scripts
4. This keeps your repo small (~5MB) and fast to clone!

---

## Troubleshooting

### "fatal: remote origin already exists"
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NEU172L_Final.git
```

### "Authentication failed"
Use a Personal Access Token, not your password!
See: https://github.com/settings/tokens

### "Repository not found"
Make sure you created the repo on GitHub first!

Good luck! 🚀
